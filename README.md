## welcome to unhacked

_unhacked_ is a weekly ctf, giving whitehats the chance to go back in time before real exploits and recover funds before the bad guys get them. 

_you are a whitehat, right anon?_

## meet schnoodle

[schnoodle](https://www.schnoodle.finance/) is a dao on ethereum mainnet, governed by the SNOOD token.

after running smoothly for its first ~year, on 6/18, the ETH-SNOOD uniswap pair was drained for over 100 ETH. 

- token (proxy): [0xd45740ab9ec920bedbd9bab2e863519e59731941](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd45740ab9ec920bedbd9bab2e863519e59731941)
- token (implementation): [0xeac2a259f3ebb8fd1097aeccaa62e73b6e43d5bf](https://etherscan.io/address/0xeac2a259f3ebb8fd1097aeccaa62e73b6e43d5bf)
- uniswap pair [0x0f6b0960d2569f505126341085ed7f0342b67dae](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0f6b0960d2569f505126341085ed7f0342b67dae)

review the code in this repo, find the exploit, and recover > 100 ETH. 

(hint: the issue is in the token implementation, so focus on `src/SchnoodleV9.sol` and `src/imports/SchnoodleV9Base.sol`. no need to look at the other files)

## how to play

1. fork this repo and clone it locally.

2. create an .env file with an environment variable for ETH_RPC_URL (or add the rpc url directly into the test file).

3. review the code in the `src/` folder, which contains all the code at the time of the hack. you can explore the state of the contract before the hack using block 14983600. ex: `cast call --rpc-url ${ETH_RPC_URL} --block 14983600 0xd45740ab9ec920bedbd9bab2e863519e59731941 "getFarmingFund()"`

4. when you find an exploit, code it up in `SchnoodleHack.t.sol`. run the test with `forge test -vvv`. the test will pass if you succeed.

5. post on twitter for bragging rights and tag [@unhackedctf](http://twitter.com/unhackedctf). no cheating.
